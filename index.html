            <h1>Conway's Game Of Life</h1>

            <h2>Description: </h2>
            <p>
                Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician 
                John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution 
                is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from human players. 
                The game is played on an infinite two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which 
                is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, 
                which are the cells adjacent to it horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

            <h2>Rules: </h2>
            <p>
                The game evolves in turns, often referred to as ticks or steps. At each step, the following transitions occur:<br>
                1. <strong>Birth:</strong> A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell. <br>
                2. <strong>Death by isolation:</strong> A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies. <br>
                3. <strong>Death by overcrowding:</strong> A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies. <br>
                4. <strong>Survival:</strong> A live cell with two or three live neighbors continues to live. <br>
            </p>
